Modifying the Service and Termination.</strong>\n        <p>\n          Skippit is always striving to improve the Service and bring you\n          additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful.

For example, Skippit would have an exclusive license to\n          screenshots of the Service that include your Content. In addition, so\n          that Skippit can prevent the use of your Content outside of the\n          Service, you authorize Skippit to act on your behalf with respect to\n          infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other users\n          or third parties.

Retroactive and Prospective Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and\n          Jury Waiver.\n        </strong>\n        <p>Except where prohibited by applicable law:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of\n            or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach\n            thereof), or the Service, regardless of the date of accrual and\n            including past, pending, and future claims, shall be BINDING\n            ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association\n            under the Consumer Arbitration Rules. The one exception to the\n            exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an\n            individual claim against Skippit in a small claims court of\n            competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside, or in San\n            Francisco, CA. Such arbitration shall be conducted by written\n            submissions only, unless either you or Skippit elect to invoke the\n            right to an oral hearing before the Arbitrator. But whether you\n            choose arbitration or small claims court, you agree that you will\n            not under any circumstances commence, maintain, or participate in\n            any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action\n            or proceeding against Skippit.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            By accepting this Agreement, you agree to the Arbitration Agreement\n            in this Section 16 (subject to existing users’ limited one-time\n            right to opt out within thirty (30) days, discussed below). In doing\n            so, BOTH YOU AND SKIPPIT GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert\n            or defend any claims between you and Skippit (except for matters\n            that may be properly taken to a small claims court and are within\n            such court’s jurisdiction). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO\n            PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING, including,\n            without limitation, any past, pending or future class actions,\n            including those existing as of the date of this Agreement.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <strong>15. Governing Law.</strong>\n        <p>\n          Except where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws\n          of California, U.S.A., without regard to its conflict of laws rules,\n          shall apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this\n          Agreement, the Service, or your relationship with Skippit.\n          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 16\n          above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\n        </p>\n        <strong>16. Venue.</strong>\n        <p>\n          Except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court\n          of competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside or in San\n          Francisco, CA, all claims arising out of or relating to this\n          Agreement, to the Service, or to your relationship with Skippit that\n          for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated\n          exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco, CA,\n          U.S.A. You and Skippit consent to the exercise of personal\n          jurisdiction of courts in the State of California and waive any claim\n          that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.\n        </p>\n        <strong>17. Indemnity by You.</strong>\n        <p>\n          You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify,\n          defend and hold harmless Skippit, our affiliates, and their and our\n          respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against\n          any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs,\n          liabilities and expenses, including attorney’s fees, due to, arising\n          out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of the\n          Service, your Content, or your breach of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <strong>18. Entire Agreement; Other.</strong>\n        <p>\n          This Agreement, along with the Privacy Policy, the Safety Tips, and\n          any terms disclosed to you if you purchase or have purchased\n          additional features, products or services we offer on the Service,\n          contains the entire agreement between you and Skippit regarding your\n          relationship with Skippit and the use of the Service, with the\n          following exception: anyone who opted out of the retroactive\n          application of Section 16 is still subject to and bound by any prior\n          agreements to arbitrate with Skippit as well as this agreement to\n          arbitrate on a going forward basis. If any provision of this Agreement\n          is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in\n          full force and effect. The failure of Skippit to exercise or enforce\n          any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver\n          of such right or provision. You agree that your Skippit account is\n          non-transferable and all of your rights to your account and its\n          Content terminate upon your death.
