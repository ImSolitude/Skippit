Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement.</strong>\n        <p>\n          By creating a Skippit account or by using any Skippit product\n          (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms\n          of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy, each of which is incorporated by\n          reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed to you if\n          you purchase or have purchased additional features, products or\n          services we offer on the Service (collectively, this “Agreement”). If\n          you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this\n          Agreement you should not use the Service.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to\n          time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect\n          changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in\n          business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be\n          posted on the Service under Settings and also on skippitapp.com, and\n          you should regularly check for the most recent version. The most\n          recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include\n          material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will\n          notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could\n          include notification through the Service or via email. If you continue\n          to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree\n          to the revised Agreement. You agree that this Agreement shall\n          supersede any prior agreements (except as specifically stated herein),\n          and shall govern your entire relationship with Skippit, including but\n          not limited to events, agreements, and conduct preceding your\n          acceptance of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <strong>2. Eligibility.</strong>\n        <p>\n          You must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on Skippit\n          and use the Service.

Modifying the Service and Termination.</strong>\n        <p>\n          Skippit is always striving to improve the Service and bring you\n          additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This\n          means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to\n          time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not\n          materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you\n          with notice before taking them.

After your\n          account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the\n          following provisions will still apply to you and Skippit: Section 5,\n          Section 6, and Sections 13 through 20.\n        </p>\n        <strong>5.

Rights You Grant Skippit.</strong>\n        <p>\n          By creating an account, you grant to Skippit a worldwide,\n          transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host,\n          store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and\n          distribute information you authorize us to access from third parties,\n          as well as any information you post, upload, display or otherwise make\n          available (collectively, “post”) on the Service or transmit to other\n          users (collectively, “Content”). Skippit’s license to your Content\n          shall be non-exclusive, except that Skippit’s license shall be\n          exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of the\n          Service. For example, Skippit would have an exclusive license to\n          screenshots of the Service that include your Content. In addition, so\n          that Skippit can prevent the use of your Content outside of the\n          Service, you authorize Skippit to act on your behalf with respect to\n          infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other users\n          or third parties. This expressly includes the authority, but not the\n          obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e.,\n          DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if your Content is taken and\n          used by third parties outside of the Service. Our license to your\n          Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example\n          laws regarding personal data protection to the extent any Content\n          contains personal information as defined by those laws) and is for the\n          limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the\n          Service and researching and developing new ones.

The one exception to the\n            exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an\n            individual claim against Skippit in a small claims court of\n            competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside, or in San\n            Francisco, CA.

Venue.</strong>\n        <p>\n          Except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court\n          of competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside or in San\n          Francisco, CA, all claims arising out of or relating to this\n          Agreement, to the Service, or to your relationship with Skippit that\n          for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated\n          exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco, CA,\n          U.S.A. You and Skippit consent to the exercise of personal\n          jurisdiction of courts in the State of California and waive any claim\n          that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.\n        </p>\n        <strong>17.

If any provision of this Agreement\n          is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in\n          full force and effect.

You acknowledge that you are participating in the Super User\n            Activities out of enthusiasm for the Services and for the\n            opportunity to earn Incentives. You and Skippit expressly agree that\n            (1) this Addendum is not an employment agreement and does not create\n            an employment relationship between you and Skippit; (2) you are not\n            an employee and never have been an employee of Skippit and (3) no\n            joint venture, franchisor- franchisee, partnership, independent\n            contractor or agency relationship is intended or created by this\n            Addendum.
